Problem Statement 
  Increasing traffic congestion leading to delay in reaching destination.

The proposed solution is expected to significantly increase the accuracy and reliability of traffic prediction using machine learning algorithms. 
By leveraging comprehensive data sources, advanced feature engineering techniques, and robust model training and optimization, we aim to provide highly accurate and timely traffic forecasts. 
The improved traffic prediction models will facilitate efficient traffic management, reduce congestion, optimize travel times, and enhance overall transportation planning and operations.	
Enhancing traffic prediction using machine learning is a crucial requirement in optimizing transportation systems and improving the overall commuting experience. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, comprehensive data collection, feature engineering, model training and optimization, and deployment, we aim to increase the accuracy and reliability of traffic predictions. This will contribute to more efficient traffic management, reduced congestion, and improved transportation planning, ultimately benefitting both traffic authorities and commuters alike.
This is a traffic prediction classifier model which analysis the traffic at a particular area to predict the amount of traffic caused particularly by cars , bikes, buses and trucks. 
The trffic is particuarly classified as light, moderate and heavy.
Random forest is predicted to be the best classifier model for the purpose showing highest accuracy.

The result concludes the the following:
•	Number of Cars (CarCount) has the most contribution to Traffic
•	Thursday and Wednesday are the most busy days for traffic
•	Peak hours of traffic are between 8:00am-10:00am and 3:00pm-6:00pm
•	Normal traffic situation counts the most
•	Heavy Traffic mostly occurs after 9:00pm
•	Friday sees the minimum Traffic
